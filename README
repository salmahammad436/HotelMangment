# Hotel Search Application

This project is a Hotel Search Application built using React and TypeScript. It allows users to search for hotels based on city, check-in and check-out dates, number of adults and children, and room type. The application fetches hotel data from an external API using Axios and displays the results in a responsive and user-friendly way.

## Features
- Search hotels by city, date range, number of adults, children, and room type
- Display hotel search results with names, ratings, review counts, and vendor information
- Retry logic for API requests in case of rate limiting (status code 429)
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop devices

## Technologies Used
- React
- TypeScript
- Axios for API requests
- CSS for responsive design

   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:

   ```

## Usage
1. Enter the city ID, check-in and check-out dates, number of adults, children, and room type.
2. Click the **Search Hotels** button to view available hotels.
3. The results will display hotel names, ratings, review counts, and vendor information.

## API Configuration
The application uses the Makcorps API to fetch hotel data. The API key is configured in the `fetchHotels` function located in `src/api/hotelService.ts`.

### Handling API Rate Limiting
If the API request limit is exceeded (status code 429), the application will retry the request up to three times with a delay between each attempt.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter the error:
```
Error fetching hotels: Request failed with status code 429
```
This means the API rate limit has been exceeded. The application will automatically retry, but if the problem persists, consider:
- Waiting for some time before trying again.
- Reducing the frequency of your search requests.
